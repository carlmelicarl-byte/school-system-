# 🏫 ElimuPro — School Management System

A complete, professional school management platform modelled on **Zeraki** (Analytics, Finance) and **SmartShule** — built for the Kenyan school system (CBC Junior Secondary + KCSE-style grading). Runs locally with **Flask + SQLite** and a modern web dashboard. No external services required.

## 🗂 Tech & architecture

```
school_system/
├── app.py            # Flask backend — REST API, role-based auth, analytics & billing engine
├── seed.py           # schema + realistic sample data generator
├── school.db         # SQLite database (auto-created by seed.py)
├── templates/index.html
└── static/
    ├── css/style.css # design system, themes, print styles
    ├── js/app.js     # SPA: routing, 15 views, SVG charts (no CDN)
    └── uploads/      # profile pictures & logos (auto-created)
```

- **No internet/CDN needed** — charts are hand-drawn SVG, fonts are system stacks
- **Role-based access enforced server-side** (Administrator / Teacher / Accounts)
- Token + cookie authentication — works in normal browsers and embedded previews
- REST API is ready to plug into real integrations (M-Pesa Daraja STK push, Africa's Talking SMS)

## 🔌 Real-world upgrades (next steps)
- **M-Pesa Daraja API** — live STK-push payments instead of manual recording
- **Africa's Talking SMS** — connect the gateway for real message delivery
- Multi-school tenancy (`school_id`) for a Zeraki-style SaaS deployment
- Parent mobile portal

## 🔐 Security notes
Demo secret key and SHA-256 password hashes suit a local deployment. For production: rotate the secret key via environment variable, use HTTPS, and consider bcrypt/argon2 hashing.
